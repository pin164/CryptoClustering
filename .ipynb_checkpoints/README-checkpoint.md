# CryptoClustering
Predict if cryptocurrencies are affected by 24-hour or 7-day price changes.

**brief description of the project**:To use <br>
**summary of approach:**<br>
>1.Prepare the Data<br>
2.Find the Best Value for k Using the Scaled DataFrame<br>
3.Cluster Cryptocurrencies with K-means Using the Scaled DataFrame<br>
4.Optimize Clusters with Principal Component Analysis<br>
5.Find the Best Value for k Using the PCA DataFrame<br>
6.Cluster Cryptocurrencies with K-means Using the PCA DataFrame<br>
7. Finally assess the impact of using fewer features to cluster the data using K-Means<br>


**location within repository**<br>
>data file : Resources/crypto_market_data.csv<br>
code to assess the clustering:Jupyter Notebook :Crypto_Clustering_V1.ipymb<br>
original template to create clustering: Jupyter Notebook :Crypto_Clustering_V0.ipymb<br>

**Code source**:Crypto_Clustering_V1.ipymb<br>

**Instructions for running the code**:jupyter notebook.  No special instructions to run the code <br>

**dependencies** The python code relies on the data file in the Resources folder<br>
